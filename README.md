## Clone This Repository

1. ```git clone https://github.com/vp-online-courses/webpack-optimization-for-production.git```
1. ```cd webpack-optimization-for-production```

## Folders

This Github Repository is very easy to use.

There are multiple folders on the root level: each folder corresponds to a specific Lesson.
Inside each folder you can find a fully functional code related to that Lesson.
For example, a folder with the name "18-using-sass-with-webpack" contains all the code that was added in Lesson 18 "Using SASS Together With Webpack".

You just need to `cd` into that folder, run `npm install`, and you are good to go!
1. Clone the Github Repository (if you haven't done it yet):
```git clone https://github.com/vp-online-courses/webpack-optimization-for-production.git```
2. `cd` into a specific folder:
`cd 18-using-sass-with-webpack`
3. Run `npm install` in order to install dependencies:
`npm install`
4. That's it! Now you can explore the code in your IDE or run the application from the Terminal.

It's very easy to find a specific folder once you know the name of the Lesson, because all folder names contain the Lesson number as well as the name of the corresponding Lesson.

If the lesson doesn't imply any code changes, then there is no folder related to that lesson. For example, Lesson 2 "What you need for this course" does not contain any code changes .
Therefore, there is no such folder in the Github Repository.

If you have any questions regarding the course, please feel free to write me via Q&A section and I will do my best to help you!
